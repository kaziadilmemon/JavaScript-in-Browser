/* Question : Create a navbar and change the color of its first element to red.*/
document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].firstElementChild.style.color="red"

/* Create a table without tbody Now use "view page source" to check whether it has a tbody or not.

 The answer is no because view page source shows the raw source of it and tbody is autocorrected there.
